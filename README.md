## Introduction

Academic Adventure is a location-based RPG style browser game that allows students to meet 
others and explore their campus and city though location based events. Students are then 
rewarded for getting involved with stat changes and a virtual currency that they can spend 
on rewards.

By accessing a web app, users can confirm their attendance at events hosted by gamekeepers 
(lecturers or societies at the university). These events can be viewed via a map which also 
tracks the userâ€™s location.


## Prerequisites, Installation, and Requirements

Python v3.9 was used for the development of this project.

The web app uses Django v4.0.1 which can be installed via pip install.

Django and all other requirements can be installed by running: 

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

Currently Academic Adventure is designed to only work in Exeter, though we hope it will be
customizable by the end of the next sprint.

To run the server, simply run the command 'python manage.py runserver' in the mysite folder.
To access the site go to your host-address/academic_adventure.

To make a registered user into a gamemaster:

run 'python manage.py shell' and then enter the following commands.

from academic_adventure.models import CustomUser
user = CustomUser.objects.get(username="YourUser")
user.gamekeeper = True
user.save()

## Testing

To run tests for this project, run the following command within the mysite folder:

'python manage.py test academic_adventure'
