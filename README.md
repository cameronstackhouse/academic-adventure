## Introduction

Academic Adventure is a location-based RPG style browser game that allows students to meet 
others and explore their campus and city though location based events. Students are then 
rewarded for getting involved with stat changes and a virtual currency that they can spend 
on rewards.

By accessing a web app, users can confirm their attendance at events hosted by gamekeepers 
(lecturers or societies at the university). These events can be viewed via a map which also 
tracks the userâ€™s location.
